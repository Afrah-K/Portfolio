## Abstract

The research focuses on analyzing and visualizing the overall scores and key statistics of the top five universities in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings from 2020 to 2023. Key metrics such as full-time equivalent students, student-to-staff ratios, international student numbers, and the female-to-male student ratio were examined. Data were gathered from the official THE website and averaged across the years. The findings revealed fluctuating results, with some lower-ranked universities surpassing their higher-ranked counterparts in certain categories. The study also assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these statistics and its influence on university rankings.
