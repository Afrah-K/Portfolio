## Abstract

The Abu Dhabi Open Data Intelligence project aimed to utilize Falcon, a large language model (LLM) developed by the Technical Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, to enhance analytics capabilities for Abu Dhabi's open data. The initiative sought to empower data-driven decision-making through the development of a voice/text engine. The project incorporated ethical AI practices, iterative development methodologies, and knowledge-sharing principles, resulting in a user-friendly interface using Streamlit or Gradio. This tool enabled intuitive interaction with the engine, allowing users to derive advanced insights from open data.
