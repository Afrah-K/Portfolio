## Overview

As part of a research paper on "Comparative Analysis of SVM and CNN in Image Classification," I developed and evaluated models for classifying images of cats and dogs. This project involved the use of both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

## Project Components

### Models

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
  - **File:** `SVM4000.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook details the implementation and evaluation of the SVM model trained on 4,000 images of cats and dogs.

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
  - **File:** `CNN4000.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook demonstrates the CNN model trained and tested on a subset of 4,000 images.
  - **File:** `CNN20000.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook showcases the CNN model trained and tested on a larger dataset of 20,000 images.

### Accuracy and Loss

The accuracy and loss metrics for the models are as follows:

| Model        | Accuracy | Loss  |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| CNN (20,000) | 89%      | 26%   |
| CNN (4,000)  | 76%      | 50%   |
| SVM (4,000)  | 61%      | -     |
