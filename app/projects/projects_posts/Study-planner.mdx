## Overview

This project focuses on developing a recommendation and scheduling system for students to optimize their study patterns. By leveraging a combination of a recommendation engine, genetic algorithms, and data analysis, the system provides personalized study timetables to enhance learning efficiency.

## Project Components

### Recommendation Engine

- **File:** `Recommendation.py`
- **Description:** Implements a recommendation engine that suggests study schedules based on the student's historical data and preferences.

### Genetic Algorithm

- **File:** `TimetableLogic.py`
- **Description:** Utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize the study timetable by considering various constraints and objectives.

### Data Analysis

- **File:** `Data_preprocessing.ipynb`
- **Description:** Notebook for preprocessing and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful patterns and insights.
- **File:** `Synthetic_DataCreation.ipynb`
- **Description:** Notebook for generating synthetic data to augment the training dataset.

### Timetable Scheduling

- **File:** `WeeklyTimetable.py`
- **Description:** Logic for creating weekly timetables based on the recommendations and genetic algorithm outputs.
- **File:** `main.py`
- **Description:** Main script that integrates all components to generate and display the final study timetable.

## Datasets
