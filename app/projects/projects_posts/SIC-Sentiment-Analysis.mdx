## Overview

As part of a project in the Samsung Innovation Campus, I developed a comprehensive Twitter sentiment analysis tool. This project involved the application of various machine learning models to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets.

## Project Components

There are several key components to this project:

### 1. Compiling the Dataset
- **File:** `Compiling_Dataset.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook includes the process of collecting and compiling the dataset for sentiment analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- **File:** `EDA_and_Preprocessing.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook contains the steps taken to explore and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning models.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis Models
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
  - **File:** `svm_model.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the SVM model for sentiment classification.
  
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):**
  - **File:** `LSTM.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook showcases the LSTM model used for analyzing the sentiment of tweets.
  
- **Random Forest:**
  - **File:** `Random_Forest.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook details the application of the Random Forest algorithm for sentiment analysis.
  
- **Naive Bayes:**
  - **File:** `Naive_Bayes.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook explains the use of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classifying tweet sentiments.
  
- **Transfer Learning:**
  - **File:** `Transfer_Learning.ipynb`
  - **Description:** This notebook illustrates the process of using transfer learning for sentiment analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Data

- **Dataset File:** `tweet_and_emotion.csv`
- **Description:** This file contains the tweet data and their corresponding sentiment labels used for training and evaluating the models.
