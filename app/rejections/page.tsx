        <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tighter"># 6th and the most recent failure.</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">Failed at getting into MBZUAI. Longest failure up till date. I started preparing in October 2022. I did research, did multiple internships, and tried getting an 8 for GPA but failed at getting into my dream university in 2023.</p>
        
        <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tighter"># 5th.</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">Failed at my Siemens, AWS internship, and technical manager interview. Almost landed an AWS internship in the first year. Almost landed a Siemens internship in senior year. Almost landed a technical manager interview just after graduating. Didn't get chosen because I was too 'young' + I had entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>
        
        <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tighter"># 4th.</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">Failed at getting an 8 CGPA. This was because of migration; I moved countries. I landed 3 days before my final exams and had no time to prepare. Got a 5/10 on my GPA, the lowest score I've ever had, which ended up affecting my semesters ahead.</p>
        
        <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tighter"># 3rd.</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">Failed at being consistent with content creation. 100% on me. I got pretty good views but wasnâ€™t able to stay consistent on my Instagram influencer journey (Posted content on productivity, AI, ML, and coding).</p>
  
        <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tighter"># 2nd notable failure.</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">Failed at Budds.us. A 'startup' I called it, but it was just a coding bootcamp when I was like 20. Posts were liked by Tinkercad on Instagram. Spoke to some parents, but nobody showed up. (Website doesn't work anymore, but I have the Insta page @buddsacademy).</p>
        
        <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tighter"># First failure of my life ever.</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">First failure of my life, getting a 9/10 on my test. Yes. I was in grade 1. I was a perfectionist. Indian mom was mad at me for losing a 1 in my math test.</p>
